## 1. What is the problem?

Software engineers spend significant amount of their time with databases. Databases grow every day. Today's Big data world we have new problems.
So now we have topics like Big Data, NoSql, Machine Learning(because of so much samples to learn) and Artificial Intelligence. These topics are hype 
and there is a so much demand for software engineers who willing to work on these topics. But RDBMS are still widely used and they will be with us for a long time. There are few reasons, first because of legacy 
of the all these systems which build on top of RDBMS and second one RDBMS is evolving too. They are actively maintaining and developing. So it still very well investment to learn more 
about databases and SQL.

   Do we really know the limitation of the RDBMS? If they are limited and should be replaced by new technologies(like NoSqls) why big tech companies still highly rely on them? And as a software engineer do we give enough 
attention how RDBMS, SQL has evolved until now? In some simple search on Google and with a few years experience on the software industry it is easy to know the basics about both of them. But are these basics enough to handle 
millions or billions of records in a table? What is the pros and cons of the simply creating index to speed up your queries?

## 2. Why do I create this project?

   As I proposed on the problem definition I don't think I follow/experiment on the topics closely enough to understand the RDBMS and database indexing to scale in large data sets. In this project I would like to 
walk through the example scenarios and best practices solving the challenges on the big datasets. 

## 3. Which problems list in this project?
 ### 3.1 What is indexing? What is the data structure under the hood?
 ### 3.2 What is concatenated index? When should we use it ?
## 4. What is the progress so far?
## 5. Which resources do you need in this project?
The samples are used in the project rely on [imdb](https://datasets.imdbws.com) and [stackexchange](https://archive.org/download/stackexchange) databases. All the samples use [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org). Databases 
will be on [docker](https://www.docker.com) and use [PostgreSQL official image](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres).
