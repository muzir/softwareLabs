## 1. What is the problem?
   Software engineers spend significant amount of their time with databases. Designing, modeling of 
data is the crucially important for the future of the software project. Data grows nearly in all segments like IOT, Web etc. and SAAS products get so much 
popularity in last 20 years. So now we have topics like Big Data, NoSql, Machine Learning(because of so much samples to learn) and Artificial intelligance. These topics are hype 
and there is a so much demand for software engineers who experts on these topics. So they paid well and most of People would like to work in these topics which make sense. But my question is
do we have enough expert on the technologies which actually still in the core of our business. RDBMS with us in last 50 years and SQL first appeared nearly same time. But the World has changed a lot as RDBMS has changed too.
Do we really know the limitation of the RDBMS? If they are limited and should be replaced by new technologies(like NoSqls) why big tech companies still highly rely on them? And as a software engineers do we give enough 
attention how RDBMS, SQL has evolved until now? In some simple saerch on Google and with a few years experience on the software industries it is easy to know the basics about both of them. But is this basics enough to handle 
millions, hundred of millions or billions of records in a table. What is the pros and cons of the simple creating index to speed up your queries?   
## 2. Why do I create this project?
    As I propesed on the the problem definition I don't think I follow this topics closely enough to understand the RDBMS and database indexing to scale in large data sets. In this project I would like tpo 
walk through the example scenarious and best practives to solve the challanges with proper indexing.
